Click 'Randomize' to remove this effect.

Once Randomize has been applied to a selection, click on the Dice icon to the right of any other effect's slider to include/exclude that effect from being randomly applied. 

For each included effect (marked by a Dice icon), click and drag its slider button right/left to increase/decrease the level of randomnization with which it is applied.

Try typing 'L' to create a loop marker for the selection and hit Play. At the start of each loop, new effects will be applied, and repeated loops will be kept in a Ripple under the Rip in the RipList. For higher Randomize levels, the effect levels are adjusted during a note's playback and this will also be recorded. If you like the Ripple, click the Tick icon to its left and it will be saved with the Rip.

Alternatively, if you copy and paste notes with Randomize applied, the copy will contain the latest effects set in stone. Note that this method does not record effect variations within a note.#

/MENUBAR_EFFECTS_CLEANUP/
